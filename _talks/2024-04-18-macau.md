Reinforcement learning agents have mastered complex games like Go, Atari, or DotA 2, outperforming the best humans on Earth. Yet, these impressive feats are constrained to games or simulations. What prevents us from training superintelligent robots using reinforcement learning? In this talk, we will explore one major roadblock: limited and imperfect sensor data. We will investigate deep memory models as a solution to this challenge. Our journey will cover a number of deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and linear transformers.
