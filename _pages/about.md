I am a PhD student working on reinforcement learning in the Prorok Lab at The University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the Toshiba Cambridge Research Lab. My research focus is on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and recurrent memory models. I am interested in using long-term memory to produce more capable robots that reason better under uncertainty. 

I completed my master's in aerospace engineering in the Space and Terrestrial Robotic Exploration lab at the University of Arizona. I previously worked on large, distributed software systems at Facebook where I focused on fault tolerance, reliability, and performance.
